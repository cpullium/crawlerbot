# crawlerbot

A machine learning starter kit. It contains everything you need to build a 2DOF (self-taught) crawler bot. 

 Information about machine learning for robotics is everywhere on the internet, but scattered and often incomplete. This kit was created as a senior design project for mechatronic engineering students at the University of North Carolina at Asheville (UNCA). We felt there should be an accessible way learn and implement fundamentals of reinforcement learning for robotics applications.  We created a python based embedded system that implements a type of reinforcement learning called “Q-learning”.

In this repository, you will find the following:

Information -
Summary of our research on Q-learning 
List of sources

Mechanical- 
	Assembly instructions
	All CAD files used to form the legs and body of the robot
	List of nuts, bolts, and loose ends

Electrical-
	A parts list of all electronic components (batteries, servos, processors, etc)
	Schematic and Data Sheet 

Programming-
	Platform and installation information
	All scripts with detailed instructions
 

This kit is only the beginning. We encourage adaptations and expansions. Have fun!
